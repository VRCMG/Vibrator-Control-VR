# Lovense-Control-VR (non official) still WIP

This programm is still heavily WIP. It should work but...

Control Lovense toys via your VR controllers.
Default settings use the right trackpad on index controllers
You can select between multiple backends. 

# Token Backend

The Token Backend uses tokens generated by the app. Only the code and not the full link need to be used.

It is confirmed working with a hush. Every other toy supporting vibratons should work but can't confirm. Also every toy is assumed to be a Hush.

# Connect Backend

The Connect Backend uses the Connect App for mobile or PC.

For the ConnectBackend I can't test currently but it should work. The idea behind it is from the https://github.com/sextech/lovense

Since the Connectbacked normally only works locally a vpn Connection or something simelar is required.

This is not developed by or associated with Lovense or Hytto. 
Thius is a educational project for fun
