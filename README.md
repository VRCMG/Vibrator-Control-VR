It currently only supports the backend that uses tokens. You need to supply a token generated from the app

#Token Backend

The Token Backend uses tokens generated by the app 
In Programm.cs you need to replace \<token> with a valid shorttoken.

#Connect Backend

The Connect Backend uses the Connect App for mobile or PC.

For the ConnectBackend I also can't test it but it should work better. The idea behind it is from the https://github.com/sextech/lovense

Since the Connectbacked normally only works locally a vpn Connection or something simelar is required.
